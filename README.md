## Brief Description of the App
Our group chose the theme of agriculture, we plan to make a web that helps farmers in cultivating land and helps to market it. First, each farmer needs to create an account, then the web asks for the category of that farmer (fruit farmer/vegetable farmer/palm oil farmer). after that, farmers enter the area of the land that they own (in hectares or m^2). After that, farmers enter the location of their land (in mountainous areas / valleys / etc.) so that the web can help choose the right fertilizer for their plants. The web will also assist farmers in providing the fertilizer dose for land per m^2 and the appropriate amount of water. After that, farmers are asked to enter their harvest (success/fail). If successful, farmers are asked to enter the amount of their harvest in tons/kilo so that the website can help farmers advertise and market their crops. The purpose of making this Web is to help improve the standard of living of farmers in the modern era in an effective way so that they can advance the agricultural sector in Indonesia as a tropical country with abundant resources, especially fertile soil.
